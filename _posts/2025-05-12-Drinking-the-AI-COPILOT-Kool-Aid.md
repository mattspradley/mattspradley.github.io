ðŸš€ Drinking the AI CoPilot Kool-Aid - **Replit is Impressive!**

I wanted to see how all the teams at a specific FIRST Robotics event performed at the World Championship. So I spent a couple of hours writing a Python script using a public API. It worked, but it was clunky.

Its first pass blew me away. It generated a complete web app using the PERN stack (minus the P). The app had a clean architecture with an API abstraction layer and a slick React frontend. Replit even found the API I was using and figured out how to call it, even though I didnâ€™t include that in my initial prompt.

There were some tricky edge cases with how the championship data was structured. I had to dig into the generated code and explain the logic to Replit so it could adjust the implementation. But I never had to directly edit the code myself.

Replit helped me generate a full-featured app with caching, analytics, and a polished UI in the same amount of time it took me to build a clunky script.

âœ… **Iâ€™M SOLD** Here's a link to the [app](https://frc-event-to-championship-journey-mattspradley.replit.app/).

That said, Iâ€™m still thinking about the implications for developers. This experience showed me that developers are still essentialâ€”for now. Understanding how the code works and being able to guide the AI is critical. But the way we build is changing fast.
