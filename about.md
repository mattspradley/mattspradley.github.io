Hi, I'm Matt Spradley. I have been married to Kelly Spradley for over 31 years. We have 3 fantastic kids; Parker, Tucker, and Jaque.

# A Little History
I have always loved technology and building things with it. I built a crystal radio when I was 10. I wrote my first BASIC program when I was 11 on an Atari 400. I wrote my first assembly language program on an Apple IIe when I was 13. I wanted to understand what made the software tick so I started studying electronics. I built a robot based on a 6502 minicomputer in high school.

I studied Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M and went on to work in the semiconductor industry at Dallas Semiconductor. I spearheaded several successful projects at Dallas Semiconductor.

I cofounded Elinc in 1999 with a colleague from Dallas Semiconductor to produce practice management software for veterinarians. Elinc was acquired by Eklin in 2005 and subsequently acquired by VCA Antech in 2009.

After Eklin was acquired I spent time at various software companies leading development teams. Recently, I cofounded Datapoint which was acquired by IDEXX.

I'm currently working at Strongarm Tech in the IoT space doing the equivalent of FitBit for Industrial workers.

On the side, I enjoy volunteering for FIRST Robotics and spending time in the Colorado mountains.
