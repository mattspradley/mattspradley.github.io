# A Little History
I have always loved technology and building things with it. I built a crystal radio when I was 10. I wrote my first BASIC program when I was 11 on an Atari 400. I wrote my first assembly language program on an Apple IIe when I was 13. I wanted to understand what made the software tick so I started studying electronics. I built a robot based on a 6502 minicomputer in high school.
I studied Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M and went on to work in the semiconductor industry at Dallas Semiconductor. I spearheaded several successful projects at Dallas Semiconductor. Two of the projects I initiated and managed were singled out by the CEO in company-wide Quarterly Meetings.
I cofounded Elinc in 1999 with a colleague from Dallas Semiconductor to produce practice management software for veterinarians. Elinc was acquired by Eklin in 2005 and subsequently acquired by VCA Antech in 2009.
I founded Impirus in 2009 to develop software to help small law firms and solo practitioners. I was working on an electronic signature feature for the Impirus CMS when I had the idea of using a webcam to capture an realtime image of the signer. I was so excited by the idea I decided to cofound Vignature to provide image-based electronic signatures.
